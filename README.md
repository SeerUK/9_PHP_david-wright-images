### A Symfony 2.2 Project

So, my Dad asked me to make a website for him to put his photography work on. I initally started the project with Wordpress, but as it turns out it wasn't flexible enough for what I wanted it to do! So, I've now decided to start it from scratch, using Symfony 2.

Bundles
---

- CoreBundle
  [ ] Global code and assets required by most (if not all) other bundles is in here.
- GalleryBundle
  [ ] Gallery categories
  [ ] Gallery images
  [ ] Galleries
  [ ] Galleries overview
- SecurityBundle
  [ ] User authentication (entity and repository
  [ ] Encryption service

This shall be my first 'real' project using Symfony 2, as I've never stuck with it before. I hope it turns out well...
