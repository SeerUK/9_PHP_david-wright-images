### A Symfony 2.2 Project

So, my Dad asked me to make a website for him to put his photography work on. I initally started the project with Wordpress, but as it turns out it wasn't flexible enough for what I wanted it to do! So, I've now decided to start it from scratch, using Symfony 2.

- CoreBundle
  - Test
- GalleryBundle
